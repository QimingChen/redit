Technologies Implemented

  [WebPacks]('https://webpack.js.org')
   Webpack is tool used in JavaScript applications which uses a dependency graph to map your project files. 
    But more specifically it uses an entry point where relevant module webpacks are determined and then the bundle is output to a specific location. Webpack runs on JavaScript and JSON but can utilize loaders for interoperability with other languages and frameworks.
  
    
     npm install --global webpack
