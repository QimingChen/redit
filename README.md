  [WebPacks]('https://webpack.js.org')
   <p>Webpack is tool used in JavaScript applications which uses a dependency graph to map your project files. 
    But more specifically it uses an <b>entry point</b> where relevant module webpacks are determined and then the bundle is <b>output</b> to a specific location. Webpack runs on JavaScript and JSON but can utilize <b>loaders</b> for interoperability with other languages and frameworks.
    ```
     npm install --global webpack
